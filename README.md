# TELANGANA-STATE-TOURISM-INSIGHTS-ANALYSIS-USING-DATA-ENGINEERING-SYSTEM

The "Telangana State Tourism Insights Analysis" project focuses on providing Telangana's government with critical insights into its tourism and culture sector. Through data analysis, it aims to identify districts with the highest tourist spots, understand tourism trends, analyze hotel tax revenues, and assess visitor data month-wise. This project utilizes data from the open data Telangana website and employs data storage, data management, and data visualization components to make data-driven decisions. By harnessing these insights, the government can strategically boost tourism development, increase revenue, and enhance the cultural and economic vibrancy of the state. 

# INTRODUCTION

Data Engineering is a set of operations that make data efficiently used by businesses.
It is required to design and build systems for gathering and storing data at stake and preparing it for further analysis. It involves gathering raw data to analyze valuable insights from the gathered data.
It involves processes such as configuring data sources to integrating analytical tools. All these systems are to be architecture, built, and managed.
The data engineering process involves activities that enable us to use vast raw data for practical purposes. Stages in Data Engineering:
1.
Data Ingestion
2.
Data Transformation
3.
Data Serving
4.
Data flow orchestration
1. Data Ingestion
•
Moves data from multiple sources to a target system which is later processed for further analysis.
2. Data Transformation
•
Makes data into a valuable form of data which involves removing duplicates, and errors, normalizing the data, and converting it into the form that is required for us to perform further processes.
3. Data Serving
•
Delivers transformed data to end users.
4. Data flow Orchestration
•
It provides visibility into the entire process and ensures that all the processes are successful.
Data Pipeline
•
In simple terms, it is a mechanism that automates the ingestion, transformation, and serving steps of the data engineering process.
•
It can also be considered as a series of automated processes that move data from one system or stage to another. 2
•
It combines the integration tools and connects sources to a data warehouse, and it also helps in loading information from one place to another.
The processes in a data pipeline can include:
•
Extraction
•
Validation
•
Transformation
•
Loading
•
Quality Checks
•
Monitoring
•
The data pipeline is beneficial because it would have been complicated to manually transfer data and perform extractions, transformations, and track changes in data without it.
Data Warehouse
•
It is a central repository for storing data in query able forms.
•
It can also be considered a regular database which is enhanced for reading and querying huge amounts of data.
•
The main advantage of a data warehouse is the historical data, as the general transactional databases do not store historical data.
•
They use data sources like flat files, relational databases, and other forms of data.
•
General databases normalize data by eliminating data redundancies and making them into different tables.
•
Such processes might involve heavy computations as each simple query demands to combine various tables.
•
We use simple queries with fewer tables in data warehouses, improving performance.
Data Analytics
•
It involves analyzing the data to find valuable insights and draw valid conclusions from the information.
•
It involves streaming analytical results from the data processed and stored.
•
It improvises business intelligence and helps businesses grow revenue and use data efficiently.
