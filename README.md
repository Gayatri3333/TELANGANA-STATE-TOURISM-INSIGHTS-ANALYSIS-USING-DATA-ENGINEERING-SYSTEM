# TELANGANA-STATE-TOURISM-INSIGHTS-ANALYSIS-USING-DATA-ENGINEERING-SYSTEM

The "Telangana State Tourism Insights Analysis" project focuses on providing Telangana's government with critical insights into its tourism and culture sector. Through data analysis, it aims to identify districts with the highest tourist spots, understand tourism trends, analyze hotel tax revenues, and assess visitor data month-wise. This project utilizes data from the open data Telangana website and employs data storage, data management, and data visualization components to make data-driven decisions. By harnessing these insights, the government can strategically boost tourism development, increase revenue, and enhance the cultural and economic vibrancy of the state. 

# INTRODUCTION

Data Engineering is a set of operations that make data efficiently used by businesses.
It is required to design and build systems for gathering and storing data at stake and preparing it for further analysis. It involves gathering raw data to analyze valuable insights from the gathered data.
It involves processes such as configuring data sources to integrating analytical tools. All these systems are to be architecture, built, and managed.
The data engineering process involves activities that enable us to use vast raw data for practical purposes. Stages in Data Engineering:
1.
Data Ingestion
2.
Data Transformation
3.
Data Serving
4.
Data flow orchestration
1. Data Ingestion
•
Moves data from multiple sources to a target system which is later processed for further analysis.
2. Data Transformation
•
Makes data into a valuable form of data which involves removing duplicates, and errors, normalizing the data, and converting it into the form that is required for us to perform further processes.
3. Data Serving
•
Delivers transformed data to end users.
4. Data flow Orchestration
•
It provides visibility into the entire process and ensures that all the processes are successful.
Data Pipeline
•
In simple terms, it is a mechanism that automates the ingestion, transformation, and serving steps of the data engineering process.
•
It can also be considered as a series of automated processes that move data from one system or stage to another. 2
•
It combines the integration tools and connects sources to a data warehouse, and it also helps in loading information from one place to another.
The processes in a data pipeline can include:
•
Extraction
•
Validation
•
Transformation
•
Loading
•
Quality Checks
•
Monitoring
•
The data pipeline is beneficial because it would have been complicated to manually transfer data and perform extractions, transformations, and track changes in data without it.
Data Warehouse
•
It is a central repository for storing data in query able forms.
•
It can also be considered a regular database which is enhanced for reading and querying huge amounts of data.
•
The main advantage of a data warehouse is the historical data, as the general transactional databases do not store historical data.
•
They use data sources like flat files, relational databases, and other forms of data.
•
General databases normalize data by eliminating data redundancies and making them into different tables.
•
Such processes might involve heavy computations as each simple query demands to combine various tables.
•
We use simple queries with fewer tables in data warehouses, improving performance.
Data Analytics
•
It involves analyzing the data to find valuable insights and draw valid conclusions from the information.
•
It involves streaming analytical results from the data processed and stored.
•
It improvises business intelligence and helps businesses grow revenue and use data efficiently.

# OVERVIEW OF TECHNOLOGIES

Docker
We utilized Docker to establish an isolated environment, enabling the installation of Apache Airflow alongside its requisite dependencies, thereby maintaining separation from the host system. Also, created a Python virtual environment within the Docker container for further encapsulation. This approach ensures a clean and self-contained setup for the Airflow project, safeguarding the local environment from disruptions.
Apache Airflow
We employed Apache Airflow to create and manage our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. This helped us automate the process of gathering, transforming, and loading data from various sources, making our data workflows more efficient and reliable. Airflow made it easier to schedule and monitor these tasks, improving our data processing capabilities.
MySQL Workbench
We utilized MySQL workbench to store our database, making it possible for our data pipeline to access and work with structured data. This allowed us to store and retrieve data in an organized way, making it readily available for our data processing tasks within the pipeline.
Amazon S3
We stored our data in Amazon S3 to ensure easy access and retrieval, especially when our data is updated. Amazon S3 serves as a secure and scalable storage solution, allowing us to always keep our data safe and available. This means that whenever our data is refreshed or changed, we can still easily access it and fetch the latest results without any hassle.
Snowflake
We chose to use Snowflake for our data warehousing needs. Snowflake provides a place where we can store our data in an organized and efficient manner. It's like a big storage facility where we can keep all our data safe and easy to access when we need it for analysis and other purposes. This helps us manage our data effectively.
Power Bi
We made use of Power BI to create visuals for our data. Power BI is a helpful tool that allows us to turn our data into meaningful charts, graphs, and reports. These visuals make it much easier to understand and interpret our data, helping us make informed decisions and communicate our findings effectively. Power BI's user-friendly interface and powerful features enable us to present our data in a visually appealing and insightful way, making it an asset for our project.
