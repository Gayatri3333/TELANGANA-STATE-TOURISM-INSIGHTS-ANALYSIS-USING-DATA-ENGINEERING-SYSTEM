We collect data on the number of tourist spots in each district. Identify the district with the highest count.
Gather data on the number of TSTDC units in each district. Analyze the correlation between TSTDC units, TSS artists, and tourist spots. Identify districts where TSTDC presence positively impacts the number of artists and tourist spots. Collect data on hotel tariffs across cities and districts. Analyze the revenue generated from hotel tariffs in each district. Gather data on hotel tariffs for different days of the week. Identify any patterns or trends in tariff variations throughout the week. Categorize hotels into price ranges. Analyze tariff trends across different price ranges within districts. Gather visitor data for each district monthly and identify peak and off-peak.
Based on the analysis, the future scope can be given as:
•
Districts with high tourist footfall can focus on improving infrastructure such as roads, transportation, accommodation facilities, and amenities to enhance the overall tourist experience.
•
Utilize insights from the analysis to target marketing efforts towards districts with unused potential for tourism. This could involve promoting lesser-known tourist spots, cultural events, and local attractions.
•
Identify districts with a high number of TSS artists but fewer tourist spots. Encourage the development of new tourist attractions, events, or experiences that leverage the cultural heritage and artistic talent of the region.
•
Use data on visitor numbers month-wise to plan promotional campaigns and events during off-peak seasons to boost tourism. This could include offering special discounts, packages, or festivals to attract visitors during slower months.
•
Implement technology solutions such as online booking platforms, mobile apps for tourist information, and digital marketing strategies to reach a wider audience and improve visitor experiences.
•
Regularly review and update tourism policies and regulations to adapt to changing market trends and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the tourism sector.
By leveraging these future scopes, each state can enhance its position as a premier tourist destination while ensuring sustainable growth and development in the tourism industry as this procedure can be applied for different states in India for their tourism industry.
